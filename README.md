# python-requests-aws4auth
Playbook for requests-aws4auth library to generate signed requests

### Background and Context
Placeholder for future research.  Came across the `requests-aws4auth` library when studying for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) certification exam for Data Analytics Specialty.  Specifically it was in Chapter 10 of the ACloudGuru course, focused on ElasticSearch.  One of the examples used this library.  The context is that one use-case is to enable an Elasticsearch endpoint with a RestAPI but require "signed requests" in order to access API.  Although I am very familiar with the `requests` python library, because I have written many applications for extracting data from Rest APIs, I was not familiar with this `requests-aws4auth` library.  Although I do not have the bandwidth to research this Python library right now, keep this repo as a placeholder to further research in the future, especially if I ever come across a project with Elasticsearch (and ELK stack: Elasticsearch, LogStash, Kibana).
